    "The goal of our analysis is to understand how the wind speed behaves over time, and propose the most adaqueate way of forecasting its _day ahead_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Developing Wind farms involves a lot of resources, both financial an natural. Before deciding to construct such enterprises, companies take several measurements of the wind resourse by placing temporary measurement towers, which collect data over one year of preferably more.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis here aims to investigate the data provided by a single tower in an undisclosed location. The selected tower has wind measurements at different hights going back to Jan 2015 but, in order to simplify the analysis, only the highest anemometer data will be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before advancing into forecasting, it is very important to be aware of the statistical behavior of the time series. In order to do that, the present Notebook focuses on the visual analysis as well as a mathematical exploration of some theorems on Time Series forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A simple library was built to help make this notebook cleaner. Because of that, most of the code used here will be injected using modules and submodules, check `main.py` and `services` for code."
